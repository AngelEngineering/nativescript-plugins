------------------------------

## Usage
The best way to understand how to use the plugin is to look at the demo app included in this repo.
The `apps/demo/` folder contains a simple NS TypeScript application that uses this plugin. Look at `apps/demo/src/plugin-demos/camera.ts` and `apps/demo/src/plugin-demos/camera.xml` for camera plugin usage, and `apps/demo/src/main-view-model.ts` for obtaining permissions before using the camera plugin. 

1. Import the plugin.
```javascript
import { NSCamera } from '@angelengineering/camera';
```

2. Create a camera instance via JS/TS or XML:
```javascript
this.cam = new NSCamera();
this.cam.id = "nscamera"
this.cam.enableVideo = true;
this.cam.confirmPhotos = true;
this.cam.defaultCamera = 'front';
    ......
//Check camera and microphone permissions first.
//Then, add this.cam to a Layout as a child and voila!
```
or
```xml
<Page xmlns="http://schemas.nativescript.org/tns.xsd" xmlns:Cam="@angelengineering/camera">
  ......
      <Cam:NSCamera height="{{ cameraHeight }}"
          id="nscamera"
          defaultCamera="front"
          enableVideo="true"
          disablePhoto="false"
          saveToGallery="true"
          showCaptureIcon="true"
          showToggleIcon="true"
          showFlashIcon="true"
          confirmPhotos="true"
          autoSquareCrop="false"
          insetButtons="true"
          insetButtonsPercent="0.02"
          shouldLockRotation="true"
          confirmRetakeText="nah"
          confirmSaveText="yeah"
          maxDimension="800"
          quality="90"
          debug="true">         
        </Cam:NSCamera>
  ......
```

3. Hook into camera events to handle videos and photos capture events along with other useful events. 

```javascript
this.cam.on(NSCamera.errorEvent, args => {
      //handle error
    });

    this.cam.on(NSCamera.toggleCameraEvent, (args: any) => {
      // update some UI/state
    });

    this.cam.on(NSCamera.photoCapturedEvent, (args: any) => {
      // args.data should be the path of the jpeg file produced by camera library
    });

    this.cam.on(NSCamera.videoRecordingReadyEvent, (args: any) => {
      //args.data should be the path of the file created with the video recording      
    });

    this.cam.on(NSCamera.videoRecordingStartedEvent, (args: any) => {
      // update some UI/state
    });

    this.cam.on(NSCamera.videoRecordingFinishedEvent, (args: any) => {
      // some other UI updates
    });

    this.cam.on(NSCamera.cameraReadyEvent, (args: any) => {
      // lets you know once native camera instance is ready and initialized
    });
```

4. Use the built-in buttons or control the camera using exposed functions in your app.

------------------------------

### Permissions
Before creating/using a Camera instance, you will need to ensure that permissions for both the Camera an the Microphone have been granted by the user. An example using the community permissions plugin can be seen in `apps/demo/src/main-view-model.ts`.

### Android Permissions
To request permissions in the demo app, we use the @nativescript-community [perms plugin](https://github.com/nativescript-community/perms). 


Ensure your AndroidMAnifest.xml has the following declarations.

```xml
<manifest ... >
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO" />
	<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />

  <application android:requestLegacyExternalStorage="true" ... >
    ...
  </application>
</manifest>
```


 To support saving to Photos Gallery for API<29 devices also add the following lines in AndroidManifest.xml 

```xml
<manifest ... >
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>

  <application android:requestLegacyExternalStorage="true" ... >
    ...
  </application>
</manifest>
```
And in your application, make sure you request these permissions if you want to use the `saveToGallery` flag. You can see an example in `apps/demo/src/plugin-demos/camera.ts`. If this flag is set and no permission has been granted, a copy will not be saved to the Device Photos.


### iOS Permissions
Add the following to `app/App_Resources/iOS/Info.plist`:

```xml
    <key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
	<string>This app requires access to your microphone to record audio</string>
	<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
	<string>This app requires access to your camera to record video and take pictures</string>
```

If you want to use the `saveToGallery` flag then you will also need to add the following and request permission from user (look at the example in `apps/demo/src/plugin-demos/camera.ts` for a working example). If this flag is set and no permission has been granted, a copy will not be saved to the Photos Gallery.

```xml
  <key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
  <string>Requires access to photo library to upload media.</string>
```

> **NOTE**: if you do use the perms plugin in a production app, make sure to read their README.md first, as using this plugin in production apps may require you to add all iOS Info.plist permission strings to avoid being rejected by automatic processing since the plugin includes code for all permission types.

## Option Interfaces
Photo taking options
```TS
export interface ICameraOptions {
  confirmPhotos?: boolean;
  saveToGallery?: boolean; //shared with video options
  quality?: number;
  maxDimension?: number;
  autoSquareCrop?: boolean;
  confirmRetakeText?: string;
  confirmSaveText?: string;
}
```

Video recording options
```TS
export interface IVideoOptions {
  videoQuality?: CameraVideoQuality;  //defaults to 720p
  saveToGallery?: boolean; //shared with photo options
  androidMaxVideoBitRate?: number; //Android-only
  androidMaxFrameRate?: number; //Android-only
  androidMaxAudioBitRate?: number; //Android-only
}
export enum CameraVideoQuality {
  MAX_480P = '480p',
  MAX_720P = '720p',
  MAX_1080P = '1080p',
  MAX_2160P = '2160p',
  HIGHEST = 'highest',
  LOWEST = 'lowest',
  QVGA = 'qvga',
}
```

------------------------------

## Caveats

*Audio Inputs* - On iOS, the plugin will prefer to use available audio inputs in the following order : bluetooth, wired and built-in. On Android, the plugin will only use the built-in device microphone at this time. Support for bluetooth devices will be added in the future. 

*App Suspension and Resume* - You should add event listeners that will tear down the Camera View and re-initialize it to avoid problems with device camera access. You can see an example in the demo application. 

*Pinch to Zoom* - for iOS this is currently only supported for rear cameras. Support for front cameras may be added in the future.

*Main Camera Button* - for both platforms, the main camera button supports both tap and long-press gestures when in video recording mode. Tap to start/stop recording, or long-press the button to record until you stop pressing the button. In photo mode, long-presses are ignored.

*Camera preview mode* - If enableVideo is false and disablePhoto is true, the camera plugin will only operate in camera preview mode. In this mode, neither the main camera button or the flash buttons will be rendered even if those options are enabled. 

*Device Sleep* - Developers should handle disabling device sleep during video recording to avoid having the device/app suspend while using the camera plugin. 

*Device Orientation Lock* - If your app has it's own orientation management system, use that instead of the plugin flag to ensure consistent behavior, particularly for iOS.  

*High Resolution and Camera Switching during Recording* - Not all cameras support the same range of resolutions on the same device, so you will experience distortion in recordings made when starting with a high-res camera, and switching to a camera that only supports a lower resolution.

------------------------------

## Utils

This plugin contains a few utility functions which may be useful for developers:

`mergeVideoFiles(inputFiles: string[], outputPath: string): Promise<File>`: Merge an array of video files produced by the camera plugin. To use it, all input video files must be MP4s with the same video/audio codec and resolution. The function takes two parameters; the first is an array of file names for the input video files and the second is a path string to save the merged video file to. 
``` js
let outputFile = await this.cam.mergeVideoFiles(videoSegmentsArray, outputPath)
```

`getVideoCodec(videoPath: string): string`: Looks through metadata for information on the video codec/format of a video file from a path.
``` js
console.log('codec:', this.cam.getVideoCodec(args.data));
```

`getVideoResolution(videoPath: string): { width: number; height: number } `: Looks through metadata for information on the height and width of a video file from a path.
``` js
console.log('Height/width:', this.cam.getVideoResolution(args.data));
```

`getVideoDuration(videoPath: string): number`: Looks through metadata to find the duration in milliseconds of the video file from a path.
``` js
console.log('video duration: ', this.cam.getVideoDuration(args.data));
```
